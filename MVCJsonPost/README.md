Sample MVC4 application showing how to post JSON objects to an MVC control using Ajax. The simple web form will show both a good (json data stringfied) and bad way to post data (form encoded). 

The actual data post code is in scripts/person.js.

Just set a breakpoint on the controller and inspect the incoming request.
